### 2.2 Tournament Top Batsman (Runs Scorer)

**Market Description:**
Predict which player will score the most runs in the tournament. Head-to-head matchups between selected players also available.

**Expected Liquidity:** HIGH
- Secondary only to tournament winner market
- Significant in-tournament trading as positions evolve
- Enhanced by team progression (more matches = more opportunities)

**Typical Odds Ranges (Pre-Tournament):**

| Player Tier | Examples | Expected Odds |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Elite Openers/No.3 from Favorites | Kohli, Rohit, Buttler, Head, Babar | 10.00 - 18.00 |
| Quality Middle Order from Contenders | Markram, Conway, Klaasen, Brook | 20.00 - 35.00 |
| Aggressive Openers from Tier 2 | Gurbaz, Charles, Rizwan | 25.00 - 45.00 |
| Supporting Role Players | Smith, Williamson, Mendis | 40.00 - 80.00 |
| Long Shot Accumulators | Various | 100.00 - 500.00 |

**Key Prediction Factors:**

1. **Batting Position:**
   - Openers and No.3 batsmen have structural advantage (face most deliveries)
   - Historical data: 85% of top scorers bat in top 3 positions
   - Middle-order players rarely accumulate enough opportunities

2. **Team Progression:**
   - Critical factor: More matches = more runs potential
   - Teams reaching final play 9 matches vs. 5-6 for group-stage exits
   - Expected progression probability must be weighted into odds assessment

3. **Opposition Strength:**
   - Group draw matters: Weaker bowling attacks = easier accumulation
   - Consider specific matchups (player vs. spin/pace strength)

4. **Form and Consistency:**
   - Recent 10-match average and strike rate
   - Conversion rate of starts (30+) into big scores (50+, 75+)
   - Historical performance in similar conditions

5. **Venue Allocation:**
   - Batting-friendly venues (Mumbai, Ahmedabad typically high-scoring)
   - Player history at specific grounds
   - Pitch degradation effects for teams playing multiple games at same venue

6. **Playing Style Alignment:**
   - Anchors vs. Aggressors: T20 rewards aggression but consistency matters
   - Powerplay vs. middle-overs vs. death-overs specialists
   - Ability to accelerate after steady start

**Statistical Benchmarks:**
- Tournament top scorer typically: 350-550 runs
- Average per innings: 40-50 runs (assuming 8-9 match progression)
- Strike rate consideration: Not directly rewarded but indicates match context

**Risk Considerations:**

- **Early Elimination:** Backing player from team that exits in group stage
- **Form Collapse:** Player entering tournament in poor form may not recover
- **Role Change:** Team strategy shifts (batting position changes, reduced overs)
- **Injury/Rest:** Key concern for aging stars or those with workload management
- **Weather/DLS:** Reduced overs matches limit accumulation opportunities
- **Tournament Pressure:** Some players underperform in World Cup environments

**Value Identification Strategy:**

1. **Model team progression probability:** Use pre-tournament odds to estimate matches played
2. **Calculate expected runs:** (Team progression probability × matches × player average)
3. **Compare to implied probability from odds**
4. **Identify mismatches:** Where market undervalues consistent performers from likely finalists

**In-Tournament Adjustment:**
- After group stage, reassess based on:
  - Current run tally and remaining matches
  - Form trajectory (improving/declining)
  - Knockout draw difficulty
  - Comparison to competitors' positions

**Each-Way Betting Value:**
- Many bookmakers offer top 3-5 finish places
- Terms typically: 1/3 odds for top 3
- Value often exists in consistent performers from teams likely reaching knockouts

---

### 2.3 Tournament Top Bowler (Wicket-Taker)

**Market Description:**
Predict which bowler will take the most wickets in the tournament. Typically includes head-to-head props between leading wicket-takers.

**Expected Liquidity:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- Less popular than batting markets but significant volume
- Active trading as wicket tallies evolve
- Enhanced interest from fantasy cricket crossover

**Typical Odds Ranges (Pre-Tournament):**

| Bowler Type | Examples | Expected Odds |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Elite Pace/Spin from Favorites | Bumrah, Rashid Khan, Starc, Archer | 12.00 - 22.00 |
| Quality First-Change/Spinners | Shamsi, Santner, Nabi, Hasaranga | 20.00 - 35.00 |
| Death Specialists from Contenders | Haris Rauf, Rabada, Mustafizur | 25.00 - 45.00 |
| Undervalued Spinners | Zampa, Kuldeep, Theekshana | 30.00 - 60.00 |
| Long Shots | Various emerging bowlers | 80.00 - 300.00 |

**Key Prediction Factors:**

1. **Bowling Role and Workload:**
   - Primary strike bowlers (overs 1-6, 16-20) have highest wicket potential
   - Minimum 3.5-4 overs per match typically required
   - Death bowlers face most aggressive batting = more wicket chances but expensive
   - Powerplay bowlers face field restrictions but batsmen take risks

2. **Team Progression:**
   - Even more critical than batting: 5 matches vs. 9 matches = huge wicket difference
   - Expected tournament progression must be weighted heavily

3. **Bowling Type vs. Conditions:**
   - **Spin bowling advantage:** Indian venues typically favor spin (65% of wickets historically)
   - **Pace effectiveness:** Early morning dew in Indian venues can assist seamers
   - **Wrist spin premium:** Leg spinners and wrong'uns particularly effective
   - **Death bowling skills:** Yorker execution, slower ball variations

4. **Opposition Quality:**
   - Weaker batting lineups = easier wickets
   - Group composition analysis: Teams with lower T20I rankings
   - Historical dismissal rates vs. specific opposition types

5. **Economy vs. Wickets Trade-off:**
   - Ultra-defensive bowlers (economy focus) take fewer wickets
   - Attacking bowlers may be expensive but take wickets in clusters
   - Middle-overs (7-15) typically lowest wicket-taking phase

6. **Historical Performance:**
   - Bowling average and strike rate in T20Is
   - Wickets per match ratio (target: 1.5+ in recent form)
   - Previous T20 World Cup performance
   - Record in Indian/Sri Lankan conditions

**Statistical Benchmarks:**
- Tournament top wicket-taker typically: 18-24 wickets
- Average per match: 2-2.5 wickets (assuming 8-9 match progression)
- Economy rate context: Sub-7.5 considered excellent in modern T20

**Risk Considerations:**

- **Format Volatility:** Single bad over can ruin figures, leading to removal from death duties
- **Team Elimination:** Even more impactful than batting markets
- **Injury Risk:** Fast bowlers particularly susceptible to workload injuries
- **Pitch Conditions:** Batting-friendly pitches reduce wicket opportunities across board
- **Team Strategy:** Defensive captaincy may prioritize economy over wickets
- **Selection Rotation:** Some teams rotate bowlers to manage workload
- **Matchup Dependencies:** Bowler effectiveness can vary wildly vs. different batting styles

**Value Identification Strategy:**

1. **Prioritize spinners at Indian venues:** Historical edge
2. **Team progression modeling:** Weight heavily (use tournament winner odds as proxy)
3. **Role security assessment:** Ensure bowler has guaranteed 4-over allocation
4. **Recent wicket-taking form:** Last 10 T20I matches strike rate
5. **Group weakness exploitation:** Bowlers facing easier groups have advantage

**In-Tournament Adjustment:**
- Monitor wicket tallies relative to matches remaining
- Wicket-taking momentum: Bowlers often go through hot streaks (5+ wickets across 2 matches)
- Knockout matchup analysis: Facing strong/weak batting lineups
- Compare current leader to competitors with more matches remaining

**Special Considerations for Spinners:**
- Often undervalued by market despite condition advantage
- Rashid Khan, Hasaranga, Kuldeep Yadav particularly strong value candidates
- Wrist spinners have higher variance but higher ceiling than finger spinners

### 2.4 Tournament Top All-Rounder

**Market Description:**
Some bookmakers offer markets for combined batting + bowling performance, often using a points system (runs + wickets × multiplier + catches).

**Expected Liquidity:** MEDIUM
- Niche market but growing in popularity
- Appeals to fantasy cricket enthusiasts
- Less standardized (points systems vary by bookmaker)

**Points System Examples:**
- Runs scored: 1 point per run
- Wickets taken: 25 points per wicket (some use 20)
- Catches: 10 points per catch (some use 8)
- Run-outs: 10 points (direct hit) or 5 points (contribution)

**Typical Candidates and Odds:**

| Player | Team | Expected Odds |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Hardik Pandya | India | 10.00 - 15.00 |
| Shakib Al Hasan | Bangladesh | 12.00 - 18.00 |
| Marcus Stoinis | Australia | 15.00 - 22.00 |
| Mohammad Nabi | Afghanistan | 18.00 - 28.00 |
| Sam Curran | England | 20.00 - 30.00 |
| Wanindu Hasaranga | Sri Lanka | 22.00 - 35.00 |
| Ravindra Jadeja | India | 25.00 - 40.00 |

**Key Prediction Factors:**

1. **Dual Threat Capability:**
   - Genuine contribution in both disciplines required
   - Batting position (top 5 preferred for runs)
   - Bowling workload (minimum 3 overs per match)

2. **Role Certainty:**
   - Some all-rounders are primarily batsmen who bowl occasionally (insufficient wickets)
   - Others are bowlers who bat low (insufficient runs)
   - Need Top 6 batting + 3-4 over bowling allocation

3. **Team Progression:**
   - Same logic as individual performance markets
   - More matches = exponentially more accumulation

4. **Fielding Contribution:**
   - Outfield vs. close-in fielding positions
   - Catch success rate (some players are specialist catchers)

**Risk Considerations:**
- Role changes mid-tournament (injury to specialist reduces all-rounder's bowling load)
- Points system variations between bookmakers make comparison difficult
- Lower liquidity = wider spreads = less favorable odds

2. **Venue-Specific Performance:**
   - Home/away records for both teams
   - Historical win percentages at specific venue
   - Pitch type preference alignment (spin-heavy teams on turning tracks)

3. **Toss Impact:**
   - **Critical in T20:** Some venues show extreme toss bias
   - Evening matches with dew: Teams bowling first often disadvantaged
   - Historical data by venue: "Bat first" vs. "Chase" success rates
   - Average margin of victory batting first vs. second

4. **Team Composition for Conditions:**
   - Spin bowling strength (India venues require minimum 2-3 quality spinners)
   - Death bowling quality (overs 16-20 economy and wicket-taking)
   - Powerplay batting aggression (overs 1-6 boundary percentage)

- **Key Player Impact:** Loss of single player (Bumrah, Rashid Khan) can shift odds significantly
- **Momentum Swings:** 2-3 over periods can completely change match trajectory
- **DLS Complications:** Rain interruptions create unpredictable scenarios
- **Umpiring Decisions:** Close LBW/caught behind calls can be match-defining

**Value Identification Strategy:**

1. **Toss-Adjusted Modeling:**
   - Calculate win probability for each toss outcome separately
   - Weight by 50% each to get true pre-toss probability
   - Compare to market odds (market often undervalues toss impact)

2. **Venue-Specific Edges:**
   - Teams with strong historical record at specific venue may be undervalued
   - Spin-heavy attacks at Chennai, Colombo often underpriced

3. **Tournament Context Arbitrage:**
   - Dead rubber matches: Backing motivated underdog vs. resting favorites
   - Must-win scenarios: Favorites under pressure, underdogs loose

4. **Line Shopping:**
   - Odds vary significantly across bookmakers (0.10-0.20 difference common)
   - Exchange vs. bookmaker spreads

**In-Play Adjustment Triggers:**
- Toss result announcement (immediate revaluation)
- Team sheets released (player availability confirmed)

- Underdog: 2.10 - 3.50
- Tie/NR: 15.00 - 35.00

**Key Factors:**
- Tie probability in T20: ~0.5-1% of matches historically
- No Result probability: Depends on weather forecast (February typically <2% risk in India)
- Super Over protocol: Ties go to Super Over, which counts as decisive result in most markets

**Value Consideration:**
Tie/NR odds almost always overpriced due to rarity and bettor excitement

---

### 3.3 Total Match Runs (Over/Under)

**Market Description:**
Predict whether combined runs scored by both teams will be over or under a set line.

**Expected Liquidity:** VERY HIGH
- Second most popular match market after winner
- Significant in-play activity as total evolves

**Typical Lines:**

| Venue Type | Over/Under Line |
|------------|-----------------|
| Batting Paradise (Mumbai, Ahmedabad) | 340-360 runs |
| Balanced Venue (Colombo, Kolkata) | 310-330 runs |
| Bowling-Friendly (Chennai on turner) | 280-300 runs |

**Key Prediction Factors:**

1. **Pitch Conditions:**
   - Pitch report (available morning of match): Fresh vs. used, grass cover, hardness
   - Historical scoring rates at venue
   - Expected pitch deterioration (day/night matches)

2. **Boundary Size:**
   - Shorter boundaries = higher scoring (55-60m vs. 65-70m makes significant difference)
   - Square boundaries vs. straight boundaries (affects six-hitting)

3. **Team Batting Strength:**
   - Combined batting depth of both teams
   - Recent scoring rates (runs per over in last 5 matches)
   - Batting order changes (pinch-hitters promoted)

4. **Bowling Quality:**
   - Combined bowling economy rates
   - Death bowling specialists (can restrict 20-30 runs in final 4 overs)
   - Powerplay wicket-taking (early wickets reduce totals significantly)

5. **Weather and Time:**
   - Dew factor in evening matches (second innings often higher scoring)
   - Overcast conditions may assist swing (lower scoring)
   - Temperature (extreme heat can lead to batting caution)

6. **Match Context:**
   - Net run rate considerations (teams may bat ultra-aggressively)
   - Must-win scenarios (less cautious cricket)
   - Tournament stage (knockout matches often tighter, lower scoring)

**Historical Benchmarks (T20 World Cups in Asia):**
- Average total: 315-330 runs
- High-scoring threshold: 360+ runs (occurs ~15% of matches)
- Low-scoring threshold: <280 runs (occurs ~20% of matches)

**Risk Considerations:**

- **First Innings Dependence:** Second innings strategy entirely depends on first innings total
- **Toss Impact:** Batting first on deteriorating pitch can lead to under
- **Early Wickets:** 3 wickets in powerplay often suppresses totals by 20-30 runs
- **Weather Interruptions:** DLS can create unusual total scenarios
- **Strategic Restraint:** Teams with large first innings lead may bat conservatively

**Value Identification:**

1. **Venue-Adjusted Modeling:**

### 4.1 Market Characteristics

**Expected Liquidity:** VERY HIGH
- T20 format ideal for live betting (continuous action, frequent scoring changes)
- Odds update after every ball (6 times per over × 20 overs = 120 updates per innings)
- Mobile betting optimization drives engagement

**Technological Requirements:**
- Real-time odds calculation engine
- Live match data feed (ball-by-ball)
- Low-latency platform (delays = arbitrage vulnerabilities)
- Automated risk management and exposure monitoring

### 4.2 Core In-Play Markets

#### 4.2.1 Live Match Winner

**Update Frequency:** After every ball

**Key Momentum Triggers:**
- Wickets: Immediate odds shift (5-15% probability swing)
- Boundaries: Gradual odds movement (1-3% per boundary)
- Dot balls: Pressure accumulation in chases (1-2% per dot in death overs)
- Strategic timeouts: Reassessment period

**Predictive Factors:**

1. **Wickets in Hand:**
   - Most critical factor in T20
   - Loss of set batsman = 10-20% win probability decline
   - 7+ wickets in hand = strong position, 4-5 = vulnerable

2. **Required Run Rate vs. Current Run Rate:**
   - Chasing team analysis:
     - RRR < 7: Comfortable position
     - RRR 7-9: Pressure but achievable
     - RRR 9-12: High pressure, unlikely without power hitters
     - RRR > 12: Very unlikely unless <5 overs remain

3. **Batting Partnership Quality:**
   - Set batsman (20+ runs) + new batsman = balanced risk
   - Two set batsmen (both 20+) = strong position
   - Two new batsmen = high risk period

4. **Over-by-Over Phase:**
   - Overs 1-6 (Powerplay): Wickets crucial, run rate secondary
   - Overs 7-15 (Middle): Accumulation phase, 1-2 wickets acceptable
   - Overs 16-20 (Death): Run rate critical, wickets in hand critical

5. **Match-Ups:**
   - Right-hand batsmen vs. left-arm spin = advantage spinner
   - New batsman vs. express pace = advantage bowler
   - Set batsman vs. part-time bowling = advantage batsman

**Value Opportunities:**

- **Overreaction to Boundaries:** Single six doesn't change fundamentals drastically
- **Underreaction to Wickets:** Market often slow to adjust to key dismissals
- **Death Over Volatility:** Overs 18-20 see wild swings, mean reversion opportunities
- **Strategic Timeout Inefficiency:** Market often doesn't adjust during breaks

#### 4.2.2 Live Total Runs (Over/Under)

**Update Frequency:** After every over, sometimes after boundaries

**Line Adjustment:**
- Line reduces based on runs scored + expected remaining runs
- Formula: Current Score + (Overs Remaining × Expected Run Rate)

**Value Identification:**
- Wickets falling = expected run rate declines = under value temporarily
- Partnership acceleration = expected run rate increases = over value
- Death over specialists batting = often undervalued by generic run rate models

#### 4.2.3 Live Team Total

**Update Frequency:** After every over

**Key Factors:**
- Current score and overs remaining
- Wickets in hand (exponential impact)
- Batting depth remaining
- Bowling quality of remaining overs

**Strategic Approach:**
- Early wickets (overs 1-6): Line often overshoots downward = over value
- Middle overs (7-15): Line generally efficient
- Death overs (16-20): High variance, difficult to predict

#### 4.2.4 Next Over Runs (Over/Under)

**Market Description:**
Predict runs scored in the next over (typically line 5.5-7.5).

1. **Bowler Type:**
   - Express pace (145+ kph): Higher variance, can be expensive or economical
   - Medium pace: Generally economical (under value)
   - Spin bowling: Depends on batsman handedness and skillset

2. **Batsman Matchup:**
   - Aggressive batsman vs. favorable bowling = over
   - New batsman (first over facing) = under
   - Set batsman vs. weak bowler = over

3. **Field Restrictions:**
   - Powerplay (2 fielders out): Over bias
   - Normal (5 fielders out): Balanced
   - Death (catchers and boundary riders): Over bias in chase scenarios

4. **Match Situation:**
   - Chasing team needing 10+ RPO: Over bias (forced aggression)
   - Team ahead of required rate: Under bias (risk management)
   - Batting first middle overs: Under bias (consolidation)

**Value Strategy:**
- Fade public overreaction to previous over (big over doesn't predict next)
- Target weak bowlers regardless of line
- Middle-overs spin to new batsmen = strong under value

|-----------|------|
| Aggressive Openers (India, England, Australia) | 52-62 |
| Balanced Approach | 44-52 |
| Conservative/Weak Openers | 36-44 |

**Key Factors:**

1. **Field Restrictions:**
   - Only 2 fielders outside circle (massive advantage to batsmen)
   - Encourages aerial shots

2. **Opening Pair Style:**

   - Anchor + Aggressor (traditional): Medium expected
   - Conservative (test approach): Lower expected

3. **New Ball Behavior:**
   - Seaming/swinging conditions = under bias
   - True bounce, flat pitch = over bias

4. **Opposition Bowling:**
   - Quality new ball bowlers (Bumrah, Starc, Shaheen) = under bias
   - Weak/inexperienced new ball = over bias

**Statistical Benchmark:**
